# DCGAN-on-Celeba-dataset
#### Here I applied Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) on the famous Celeba dataset using Pytorch. The reference and model for my project was taken from the paper, "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Alec Radford, Luke Metz and Soumith Chintala.
